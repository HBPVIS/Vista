JswJoystickDriver
-----------------

You need version 1.5.7 of the libjsw. A copy can be found in the resources
subdirectory.

This is a joystick driver using the Linux/Bsd Joystick wrapper library
jsw.  See http://www.battlefieldlinux.com/wolfpack/libjsw.  This URL
seems to be down as of May 2010. The 1.5.8 source can however still be
downloaded from freshmeat at http://freshmeat.net/projects/libjsw/.
Since there were no changes to the project since 2004, we might
consider switching to another joystick wrapper library (see
e.g. http://plib.sourceforge.net/js/index.html).

The jsw library is covered by the GPL

The code was developed on the basis of the linux kernel support for joysticks
and the jsw library version 1.5.7, tested on Ubuntu 8.04.
