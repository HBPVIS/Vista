Vista uses CMake (www.cmake.org/) with version 2.8.5 or greater.
Furthermore, it requires custom cmake extensions called VistaCMakeCommon, which can be checked out from the svn or downloaded from sourceforge.
To ensure cmake finds the VistaCMakeCommon, either define the VISTA_CMAKE_COMMON environment variable, set the CMakeModulePath appropriately, or place it as a subfolder under the VistaCoreLibs main directory.

External dependencies:
The main external dependencies are OpenSG 1.8 and glut (recommended: freeglut), which are needed for the Kernel and KernelOpenSGExt.
Additional dependencies are used by optional device driver packages, which can be enabled or disabled in the cmake gui.
Furthermore, the Kernel can be built with ZeroMQ support for reliable multicasting.
CMake will try to find these dependencies automatically. For this, the depdendencies should be located in the CMakeModulePath or a path defined in the VISTA_EXTERNAL_LIBS environment variable.
To find the dependencies, they should follow a special deployment rule. They are searched for in all folders of type
  */NAME
  */NAME/HWARCH
  */NAME-VERSION
  */NAME-VERSION/HWARCH
  */NAME/NAME-VERSION
  */NAME/NAME-VERSION/HWARCH
where NAME is the name version of the package (either all-upper, all-lower, or as in dependency), VERSION is the version (e.g. 1.4, 2.8.5).
The HWARCH subdir is important to differenciate different build types for different architecures, e.g. win32, win32.vc9, win32-x64.vc10, LINUX, LINUX.X86_64.

Configure Vista with cmake and build it using the generated project files. If you want to install it, choose an appropriate CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in cmake, and the install using 'make install' or by building the INSTALL project in msvc.
