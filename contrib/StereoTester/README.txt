Use this demo to test if your 3D display is set up right.
Please compile the program and run it with your init file. If run on a
Pi-CASSO system, you just need to start the start_picasso.sh from your build directory.
What do you see? If you see a long bar going from short behind the screen to
the horizon, everything is fine. If you see a triangle coming out of your screen,
you should switch either the projectors or the eye positions in your display
configuration file.
